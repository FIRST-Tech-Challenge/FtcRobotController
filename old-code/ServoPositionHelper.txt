/*
 * This file contains example code designed to help your team find the signal to send
 * your servos so that they move to your desired location.
 * It is a TeleOp mode, and uses the gamepad to increment or decrement the servo position
 * while displaying that position as Telemetry on your Driver Station.
 *
 * To use this program, start with the servo mounted to your robot and the servo attachment
 * not installed yet. Then hit "init" on your drivers station to move the servo to a known "halfway"
 * position. This should be a desired state of your mechanism, like a wrist pointed straight out
 * ready to interact with game elements. On init, this code moves the servo to the "0.5" position.
 * This is halfway through the throw of the servo. So if your servo has 180° of range, this starts
 * it at 90°.
 *
 * Once your servo attachment is installed, hit the START button. This will allow you to drive the
 * servo using your gamepad. Pressing the Y(△) button will increase the signal, while pressing
 * A(X) will decrease the position.
 * If the servo is incrementing too far, or not far enough. You can adjust the rate by pressing
 * D-pad up, or d-pad down.
