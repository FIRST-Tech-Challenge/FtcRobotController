 * This OpMode executes a basic Tank Drive Teleop for a two wheeled robot using two REV SPARKminis.
 * To use this example, connect two REV SPARKminis into servo ports on the Expansion Hub. On the
 * robot configuration, use the drop down list under 'Servos' to select 'REV SPARKmini Controller'
 * and name them 'left_drive' and 'right_drive'.

 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
