## NOTICE

This repository uses the [FIRST Tech Challenge FtcRobotController](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) project for the CENTERSTAGE (2024-2025) competition season.

## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a *FIRST* Tech Challenge competition robot.  To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.

## Requirements
To use this Android Studio project, you will need Android Studio 2021.2 (codename Chipmunk) or later.

To program your robot in Blocks or OnBot Java, you do not need Android Studio.

## Getting Started
If you are new to robotics or new to the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the [FTC Blocks Tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html) to get familiar with how to use the control system:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[FTC Blocks Online Tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html)

Even if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the [FTC Blocks tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html), and then migrate to the [OnBot Java Tool](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/onbot_java/OnBot-Java-Tutorial.html) or to [Android Studio](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/android_studio_java/Android-Studio-Tutorial.html) afterwards.

## Downloading the Project
If you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo.  Note that if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download this repository.

* If you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController.git</p>

* Or, if you prefer, you can use the "Download Zip" button available through the main repository page.  Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.

* You can also download the project folder (as a .zip or .tar.gz archive file) from the Downloads subsection of the [Releases](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/releases) page for this repository.

* The Releases page also contains prebuilt APKs.

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").

## Getting Help

### Sample OpModes
This project contains a large selection of Sample OpModes (robot code examples) which can be cut and pasted into your /teamcode folder to be used as-is, or modified to suit your team's needs.

Samples Folder: &nbsp;&nbsp; [/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples](FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples)

The readme.md file located in the [/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode](TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode) folder contains an explanation of the sample naming convention, and instructions on how to copy them to your own project space.
