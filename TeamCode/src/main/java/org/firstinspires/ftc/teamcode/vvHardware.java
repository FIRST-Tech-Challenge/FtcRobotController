/*
 * This file works in conjunction with the External Hardware Class sample called: ConceptExternalHardwareClass.java
 * Please read the explanations in that Sample about how to use this class definition.
 *
 * This file defines a Java Class that performs all the setup and configuration for a sample robot's hardware (motors and sensors).
 * It assumes four motors (left_front, right_front, left_back, right_back)
 * Sensors three (2M distance x2, color)
 *
 * This one file/class can be used by ALL of your OpModes.
 *
 * Where possible, the actual hardware objects are "abstracted" (or hidden) so the OpMode code just makes calls into the class,
 * rather than accessing the internal hardware directly. This is why the objects are declared "private".
