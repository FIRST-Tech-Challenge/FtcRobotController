 * This is NOT an opmode.

 * In this case that robot is a Pushbot.
 * See PushbotTeleopTank_Iterative and others classes starting with "Pushbot" for usage examples.
 *
 * This hardware class assumes the following device names have been configured on the robot:
 * Note:  All names are lower case and some have single spaces between words.
 *
 * Motor channel:  Left  drive motor:        "left_drive"
 * Motor channel:  Right drive motor:        "right_drive"
 * Motor channel:  Manipulator drive motor:  "left_arm"
 * Servo channel:  Servo to open left claw:  "left_hand"
