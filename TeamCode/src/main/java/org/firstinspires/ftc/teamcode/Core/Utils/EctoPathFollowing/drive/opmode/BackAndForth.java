/*
 * Op mode for preliminary tuning of the follower PID coefficients (located in the drive base
 * classes). The robot drives back and forth in a straight line indefinitely. Utilization of the
 * dashboard is recommended for this tuning routine. To access the dashboard, connect your computer
 * to the RC's WiFi network. In your browser, navigate to https://192.168.49.1:8080/dash if you're
 * using the RC phone or https://192.168.43.1:8080/dash if you are using the Control Hub. Once
 * you've successfully connected, start the program, and your robot will begin moving forward and
 * backward. You should observe the target position (green) and your pose estimate (blue) and adjust
 * your follower PID coefficients such that you follow the target position as accurately as possible.
 * If you are using SampleMecanumDrive, you should be tuning TRANSLATIONAL_PID and HEADING_PID.
 * If you are using SampleTankDrive, you should be tuning AXIAL_PID, CROSS_TRACK_PID, and HEADING_PID.
 * These coefficients can be tuned live in dashboard.
 *
 * This opmode is designed as a convenient, coarse tuning for the follower PID coefficients. It
 * is recommended that you use the FollowerPIDTuner opmode for further fine tuning.
