# Listeners

:::note
Listeners are always executed in the order that they are [hooked](#the-concept-of-hooking), so the order in which
they're hooked may be important.
:::

## Overview

*okay, now that that's out of the way...*

Listeners... the pièce de résistance of the Scheduler API!

Like 9-year-olds may subscribe to Mr. Beast to watch the latest 100,000$ boys vs girls last to leave cheeseburger
challenge when it comes out, we can also subscribe to events with the Listener to do things when the event occurs!

If we were to strip all the fancy abstraction off of a listener that's been [hooked](#the-concept-of-hooking)
to the Scheduler, we would end up with something like this:

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  while (true) { // The loop is the scheduler
      if (condition) { // The if is the listener
        // do something
      }
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  while (true) { // The loop is the scheduler
      if (condition) { // The if is the listener
        // do something
      }
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bf" label="Brainf***">

  ```brainfuck
  +[>condition[do something[-]]<]
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Pretty simple, right? Well, that's exactly what a listener is. It just checks for a condition, and does something if it's true.
Except it's more versatile than just that.

For example, let's say we want to alert our driver when the lift is too high, and slow the robot down...

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  // Creates the listener by passing in the condition to listen to
  new Listener(() -> lift.getHeight() > 1000)

      // Runs only once when the condition becomes true
      .onRise(() -> telemetry.addLine("Lift is too high, we're slowing the bot down!"))

      // Constantly called while the condition is true
      .whileHigh(() -> drive.setPowerMultiplier(.5));

  Scheduler.launch(this) // Listener only works when the Scheduler is running, needs to be in a LinearOpMode
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  // Creates the listener by passing in the condition to listen to
  Listener { lift.height > 1000 }

      // Runs only once when the condition becomes true
      .onRise { telemetry.addLine("Lift is too high, we're slowing the bot down!") }

      // Constantly called while the condition is true
      .whileHigh { drive.powerMultiplier = .5 }

  Scheduler.launch(this) // Listener only works when the Scheduler is running, needs to be in a LinearOpMode
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
`onRise`, `onFall`, `whileHigh`, and `whileLow` all return the same Listener object, so you can chain them together as
seen above, instead of explicitly stating the object name every time.
:::

Every time the Scheduler loops, it'll evaluate the passed in lambda, and fire all the events subscribed to the
corresponding state.

You might have noticed the `onRise` and `onFall`, and may be a little confused right now... Well here's a diagram to help:

![Listener Diagram](/img/diagrams/signal-edge.svg)

You can see four distinct words:
 - Low:  The condition is false
 - Rise: The condition went from false to true
 - High: The condition is true
 - Fall: The condition went from true to false

Similarly, the Listener class has four subscription methods:
 - `whileHigh - (or whileTrue)`
 - `whileLow -- (or whileFalse)`
 - `onRise ---- (or onJustTrue)`
 - `onFall ---- (or onJustFalse)`

You're (probably) a smart (enough) cookie; you can probably figure out what they mean. If not, it's fine! Just look at the method
documentation for more detailed examples!

### The concept of hooking🪝

*This isn't super important to know, so you could skip it if you really wanted—I just wanted to explain it real
quick as it comes up a bit.*

When you first create a Listener, nothing happens. It's not evaluated and updated every loop by the Scheduler; it just
sits there and looks pretty.

It's only when you subscribe to the listener (or run `Listener.hook`) that it starts being evaluated and updated (i.e.
it gets hooked).

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  Listener listener = new Listener(() -> true); // Not hooked (not in Scheduler's list of listeners)

  listener.whileHigh(() -> ...); // Now it's hooked automagically

  listener.hook(); // Also hooks it w/out subscribing to any events (No diff made here b/c it's already hooked)

  listener.whileHigh(() -> ...); // It's already hooked, so nothing changes
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  val listener = Listener { true } // Not hooked (not in Scheduler's list of listeners)

  listener.whileHigh { ... } // Now it's hooked automagically

  listener.hook() // Also hooks it w/out subscribing to any events (No diff made here b/c it's already hooked)

  listener.whileHigh { ... } // It's already hooked, so nothing changes
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
This can actually be used to your advantage with [listener.hook](#listenerhook) by pre-hooking a listener
before some other to run the former listener first.

I mean, that *is* a very niche situation, so do with it what you will Ig lol.

## Listener methods

### Construction

Constructs a new Listener without hooking it (see: [hooking](#the-concept-of-hooking)).

<ParamsList params={[
  {
    name: 'condition',
    type: '() -> Boolean',
    desc: 'The condition to listen to',
    typeLink: TypeLinks.LAMBDA,
  },
]}/>

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

  // Creates a new Listener that checks if 5 seconds have passed
  Listener timer = new Listener(() -> System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime > 5000);

  // Creates a listener which always evaluates to true, so it'll always be high
  Listener alwaysTrue = new Listener(() -> true);
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()

  // Creates a new Listener that checks if 5 seconds have passed
  val timer = Listener { System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime > 5000 }

  // Creates a listener which always evaluates to true, so it'll always be high
  val alwaysTrue = Listener { true }
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### listener.onRise()

Runs the given callback whenever the condition goes from false to true (i.e. it's on the rising edge)

:::info Equivalent to:
```java
boolean wasHigh = false;

while (true) {
    boolean isHigh = condition();

    if (isHigh && !wasHigh) {
        // Do thing
    }

    wasHigh = isHigh;
}

  val gamepadA = Listener { gamepad1.a }

  // Runs every loop while the A button is not pressed
  gamepadA.whileLow { telemetry.addLine("A button is not being held!") }
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### listener.hook()

[Hooks](#the-concept-of-hooking) the Listener to the Scheduler, does nothing if it's already hooked.

Only reason I'd imagine you'd want to do this is if you did [Scheduler.reset](./scheduler#schedulerreset) and want
to hook the Listener back up. I don't know why you'd reset the Scheduler in the first place, but you go, girl!!!

Actually, I guess you can use it for hooking up a listener before another certain listener in advance, to keep things
running in the right order, but that's a very nice case...

Anyway, here's an example:

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  Listener listener = new Listener(() -> ...);

  listener.hook(); // Hooks the listener to the Scheduler

  Scheduler.reset(); // Resets the Scheduler

  listener.hook(); // Hooks the listener back up

  listener.hook(); // Does nothing since it's already hooked
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  val listener = Listener { ... }

  listener.hook() // Hooks the listener to the Scheduler

  Scheduler.reset() // Resets the Scheduler

  listener.hook() // Hooks the listener back up

  listener.hook() // Does nothing since it's already hooked
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### listener.destroy()

Destroys the Listener, removing it from the Scheduler, and clearing its actions. Leaves the condition alone, though.

Again, not entirely sure why you'd do this, but if you have a good enough reason to do it, you can probably figure out
how to use it yourself. Knock yourself out!!!

## Listener method aliases

Supported aliases for the subscription methods are:
 - `onJustTrue(callback: Runnable) = onRise(callback)`
 - `onJustFalse(callback: Runnable) = onFall(callback)`
 - `whileTrue(callback: Runnable) = whileHigh(callback)`
 - `whileFalse(callback: Runnable) = whileLow(callback)`

## Static Listener methods

### Listener.always()

A static instance of a Listener that's always true, useful for when you want to run something every loop, but don't
want to (or can't) use the [beforeEach](./scheduler-model#beforeeach) or [afterEach](./scheduler-model#aftereach)
blocks for whatever reason.

**Note that you can only pass in a method to run every loop; you can't use `onRise`, `onFall` or `whileLow` with this
Listener; It implicitly calls `whileHigh`**

Keep in mind that this is only hooked the first time it's used (unless you explicitly hook it, of course)

<ParamsList params={[
  {
    name: 'callback',
    type: 'Runnable',
    desc: 'The callback to run every loop',
    typeLink: TypeLinks.LAMBDA,
  },
]}/>
<ReturnsItself/>

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  Listener.always(() -> telemetry.addLine("This will run every loop!"));
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  Listener.always { telemetry.addLine("This will run every loop!") }
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Listener builders

For convenience, you can combine multiple listeners/conditions into one using a variety of logical operators.

The syntax is as follows:
`listener1.whateveroperator(listener2)` or `listener.whateveroperator(() -> someBoolean)`

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  Listener gamepadA = new Listener(() -> gamepad1.a);
  Listener gamepadB = new Listener(() -> gamepad1.b);

  // True if both A and B are pressed
  Listener gamepadA_and_B = gamepadA.and(gamepadB);

  // True if either A or X are pressed
  Listener gamepadA_or_X = gamepadA.or(() -> gamepad1.x);

  // True if A is pressed and B is not pressed
  Listener gamepadA_and_notB = gamepadA.and(gamepadB.not());

  // True if A is pressed and either B or X are pressed
  Listener gamepadA_or_B_or_X = gamepadA.or(gamepadB).or(() -> gamepad1.x);

  // True if A is pressed and B is not pressed, or if B is pressed and A is not pressed
  Listener gamepadA_xor_B = gamepadA.xor(gamepadB);
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  /* operator funs plus, div, and not are overridden for and, or, and not! */
  /* The rest are infix functions */

  val gamepadA = Listener { gamepad1.a }
  val gamepadB = Listener { gamepad1.b }

  // True if both A and B are pressed
  val `gamepadA & B` = gamepadA + gamepadB

  // True if either A or X are pressed
  val `gamepadA | X` = gamepadA / { gamepad1.x }

  // True if A is pressed and B is not pressed
  val `gamepadA & not B = gamepadA + !gamepadB

  // True if A is pressed and either B or X are pressed
  val `gamepadA | B & X` = gamepadA / gamepadB / { gamepad1.x }

  // True if A is pressed and B is not pressed, or if B is pressed and A is not pressed
  val `gamepadA ^ B` = gamepadA xor gamepadB
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution Important
If you're using **Kotlin**, *please* read the note in the code above about using parentheses to make sure stuff works as expected.

```kt
// works as expected
(gamepadA + gamepadB).onRise { ... }

// also fine
(gamepadA / { !gamepad1.x }).onRise { ... }

// performs the `onRise` on `gamepadB` only, THEN performs the `and` on the gamepadA with gamepadB
// aka it's probably not what you intend lol
// this-will-error
gamepadA + gamepadB.onRise { ... }
```
:::

Currently supported functions/operators are:
 - `listener.and( otherListener )`
 - `listener.or( otherListener )`
 - `listener.xor( otherListener )`
 - `listener.nand( otherListener )`
 - `listener.nor( otherListener )`
 - `listener.xnor( otherListener )`
 - `listener.not( otherListener )`
