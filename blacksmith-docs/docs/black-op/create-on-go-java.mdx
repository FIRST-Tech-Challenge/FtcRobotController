# CreateOnGo (Java)

:::caution Important
This only works if you extend the `BlackOp` class. More info about that [here](../../etc/blackop). It's essentially LinearOpMode with
a few extra utilities, and it's made for use with the Blacksmith Library.

**If you're using Kotlin, check out [createOnGo/evalOnGo](./create-on-go-kt) for a more versatile and idiomatic method**
:::

You know how in a typical OpMode you have to be all like this or something?

```java
private MyArmClass myArm;

@Override
public void init() throws InterruptedException {
    myArm = new MyArmClass(...) // ugly duplication of class names & extra boilerplate smh my head
}
```

With `@CreateOnGo`, you can simply do this instead:

```java
@CreateOnGo
private MyArmClass myArm; // (Sadly doesn't work with final variables D:)
```

Yep, that's it. Of course, there is one small teeny weeny itsy-bitsy caveat though:

**The specific class type MUST have a no-args constructor, or it will error.**

:::tip
On the bright side, BlackOp contains a global `hwMap` and a global `mTelemetry` you can use!
:::

```java
public class MyOp extends BlackOp {
    @CreateOnGo
    private MyClaw myClaw;

    // this-will-error
    @CreateOnGo
    // this-will-error
    private MyWife maiWaife;
}

class MyClaw {
    // Has no-args constructor, so it's valid
    public MyClaw() { this(BlackOp.hwMap) }

    // It's fine if there's additional multi-arg constructors
    public MyClaw(HardwareMap hwMap) { ... }
}

class MyWife {
    // No no-args constructor, will throw exception when tries to @CreateOnGo
    // (Also you shouldn't be objectifying women)
    public MyWife(Tenges cost)
}
```
