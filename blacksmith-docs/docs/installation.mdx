# Installation

Getting Blacksmith into your project is simple and it can be incrementally adopted (i.e. you don't have to immediately
convert your whole project to Blacksmith)

To add it, first, open your root level `build.dependencies.gradle` file

Then, in the `dependencies` block, add the following:
```groovy
implementation 'com.github.RR-9527:robot-code-v2:0.2'
```

And under the `repositories` block:
```groovy
 maven { url = 'https://jitpack.io' }
 maven { url = 'https://maven.brott.dev/' }
```

All together, it should look something like this (pic from a brand-new project):

Then, open your root level `build.common.gradle` file, scroll down, find `minSdkVersion 23`, and change it to `minSdkVersion 24`

In Android Studio, it should look like:

Finally, it should ask you if you want to sync the gradle files; click `Sync Now`

If that doesn't show up, just click on `File > Sync Project with Gradle Files`

:::tip
Once you're done with this, I **highly** recommend setting up [GlobalUnits (click me)](./util/global-units). It's not required per
se, but it makes Blacksmith much more convenient.
